I went into the layout folder under recources and into activity_main.xml to find the layout for this project. There i found dubbled pressed the white layout with something on it.
There after i came to content_main.xml were i found the string for Hello world!. I then pressed the lightbulb next to the variable for Hello world and then pressed extract string variable. see code below
"android:text="@string/variableString""

This made it so that a string variable was made in the folder values in strings.xml where i could change varable and it would change it in the layout. As you can see in the code bewlow:
"<string name="variableString">This is much easier to find now.</string>"
